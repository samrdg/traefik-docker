# traefik-docker

*Traefik* is an open source router for services and works with *Docker* containers.

In this repository you will find examples in *docker-compose* format for self-hosted services with the combination of the two platforms aforementioned.

Remember to change the placeholder domain **domain.localhost** with your own.

I hope these are useful to you in your quest to learn more about this kind of setup. I certainly do.
My goal is to make the configuration files as self-contained and minimalist as possible for each service.
Although I'll try to comment each section this is not a how-to guide.
